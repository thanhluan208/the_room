            It was 1986 when a whole family of four people were heard to suffer from a mass murder. They lived in a house, which after being investigated by police has been abandoned ever since.

            But one day, you wake up and find yourself inside that house.

            You must have been kidnapped in your sleep. What does the kidnapper want from you? Your money? Your life?

            Now hurry up and find the key to get out before someone comes back...
